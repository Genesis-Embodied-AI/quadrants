# Graph

Graphs reduce kernel launch overhead by capturing a sequence of GPU operations into a graph, then replaying it in a single launch.

## Backend support

Both features run on every backend. They are *hardware accelerated* on CUDA (via CUDA graphs) and AMDGPU (via HIP graphs); `graph_do_while` additionally requires CUDA SM 9.0+ / Hopper for its hardware-accelerated path. On other backends, `graph=True` is silently ignored and the kernel runs via the normal launch path, and `graph_do_while` falls back to a host-side do-while loop that copies the condition value GPU → host each iteration (causing a pipeline stall — see [Caveats](#caveats)).

| Feature | `qd.cuda` SM 9.0+ | `qd.cuda` < SM 9.0 | `qd.amdgpu` | `qd.metal` | `qd.vulkan` | `qd.cpu` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `graph=True` | hardware accelerated | hardware accelerated | hardware accelerated | runs (no acceleration) | runs (no acceleration) | runs (no acceleration) |
| `graph_do_while` | hardware accelerated | host fallback | host fallback | host fallback | host fallback | host fallback |
| [nested `qd.kernel`](#calling-another-qdkernel-nested-subgraphs) | hardware accelerated | hardware accelerated | hardware accelerated | sequential fallback | sequential fallback | sequential fallback |

AMDGPU `graph_do_while` falls back to the host-side loop because HIP does not currently expose conditional / while graph nodes (as of ROCm 7.2).

## Basic usage

Add `graph=True` to a `@qd.kernel` decorator:

```python
@qd.kernel(graph=True)
def my_kernel(
    x: qd.types.ndarray(qd.f32, ndim=1),
    y: qd.types.ndarray(qd.f32, ndim=1),
):
    for i in range(x.shape[0]):
        x[i] = x[i] + 1.0
    for i in range(y.shape[0]):
        y[i] = y[i] + 2.0
```

The top level for-loops will be compiled into a single graph. The parallelism is the same as before, but the launch latency much reduced.

The kernel is used normally — no other API changes are needed:

```python
x = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, shape=(1024,))
y = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, shape=(1024,))

my_kernel(x, y)  # first call: builds and caches the graph
my_kernel(x, y)  # subsequent calls: replays the cached graph
```

This works the same way on CUDA and AMDGPU. The cache is keyed per (compiled-kernel-specialization, launch-id), so different template instantiations (different field bindings, etc.) get their own cached graph.

### Restrictions

- **No struct return values.** Kernels that return values (e.g. `-> qd.i32`) cannot use graphs. An error is raised if `graph=True` is set on such a kernel.
- **Primal kernels only.** The `graph=True` flag is applied to the primal (forward) kernel only, not its adjoint. Autodiff kernels use the normal launch path.
- **Device-resident ndarrays.** Graph mode bakes device pointers into the cached graph, so all ndarray arguments must be on the GPU. Passing a host-resident ndarray raises an error.
- **`qd_stream` is incompatible** with `graph=True`. Choose one or the other.

### Passing different arguments

You can pass different ndarrays to the same kernel on subsequent calls. The cached graph is replayed with the updated arguments — no graph rebuild occurs:

```python
x1 = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, shape=(1024,))
y1 = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, shape=(1024,))
my_kernel(x1, y1)  # builds graph

x2 = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, shape=(1024,))
y2 = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, shape=(1024,))
my_kernel(x2, y2)  # replays graph with new array pointers
```

### Fields as arguments

When different fields are passed as template arguments, each unique combination of fields produces a separately compiled kernel with its own graph cache entry. There is no interference between them.


## Calling another `qd.kernel` (nested subgraphs)

From inside a `graph=True` kernel you can call another `@qd.kernel` as if it were an ordinary function. The child kernel is **embedded as a subgraph** (a child-graph node) inside the parent's graph at the call site — it is not launched separately, so there is no extra launch overhead:

```python
@qd.kernel
def child(a: qd.types.ndarray(qd.f32, ndim=1)):
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):
        a[i] = a[i] * 2.0

@qd.kernel(graph=True)
def parent(a: qd.types.ndarray(qd.f32, ndim=1)):
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):     # parent's own work
        a[i] = a[i] + 1.0
    child(a)                        # embedded as a subgraph here
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):     # more parent work, runs after the child
        a[i] = a[i] + 1.0
```

Child calls execute in source order, interleaved with the parent's own top-level for-loops. You can call several children, and the same child more than once; each call becomes its own child-graph node.

```python
parent(a)   # builds the parent graph, embedding `child` as a child-graph node
parent(a)   # replays the cached graph (child included)
```

The child does not need `graph=True` — only the outermost (parent) kernel does. The child runs with its own arguments resolved from the parent call.

### Restrictions

- **The parent must be `graph=True`.** Calling a `qd.kernel` from a plain (non-graph) kernel raises an error. (Calling a `qd.func` from any kernel works as before and is unrelated to this feature.)
- **Arguments are pass-through (v1).** Each argument to a child call must be one of the parent's own parameters or a literal constant. Computed/derived arguments are not yet supported.
- **Positional arguments only** for child calls (no keyword arguments yet).
- **One level deep (v1).** A child embedded as a subgraph cannot itself call further child kernels yet.
- The same per-graph restrictions apply to the child as to any graph kernel: no struct return values, device-resident ndarrays only, no autodiff stack.

Different ndarrays can be passed across calls just like for a plain `graph=True` kernel: the cached parent graph is replayed and each embedded child's argument pointers are refreshed to match the current call (no rebuild).

> Currently hardware-accelerated on CUDA and AMDGPU (the child is embedded as a CUDA / HIP child-graph node). On Metal, Vulkan, and CPU the child is run via an in-order sequential launch at the call site (same observable result, no graph acceleration). Nested calls inside a `graph_do_while` are supported on CUDA SM 9.0+ (hardware conditional nodes); they are not yet supported where `graph_do_while` runs through a host-side fallback loop (AMDGPU, Metal, Vulkan, CPU).


## GPU-side iteration with `graph_do_while`

For iterative algorithms (physics solvers, convergence loops), you often want to repeat the kernel body until a condition is met, without returning to the host each iteration. Use `while qd.graph_do_while(flag):` inside a `graph=True` kernel:

```python
@qd.kernel(graph=True)
def solve(x: qd.types.ndarray(qd.f32, ndim=1),
          counter: qd.types.ndarray(qd.i32, ndim=0)):
    while qd.graph_do_while(counter):
        for i in range(x.shape[0]):
            x[i] = x[i] + 1.0
        for i in range(1):
            counter[()] = counter[()] - 1

x = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, shape=(N,))
counter = qd.ndarray(qd.i32, shape=())
counter.from_numpy(np.array(10, dtype=np.int32))
solve(x, counter)
# x is now incremented 10 times; counter is 0
```

The argument to `qd.graph_do_while()` must be the name of a scalar `qd.i32` ndarray parameter. The loop body repeats while this value is non-zero.

- On CUDA SM 9.0+ (Hopper), this uses CUDA conditional while nodes — the entire iteration runs on the GPU with no host involvement.
- On older CUDA GPUs, AMDGPU, and non-GPU backends, it falls back to a host-side do-while loop (see [Caveats](#caveats) and the [backend support table](#backend-support)).

### Patterns

**Counter-based**: set the counter to N, decrement each iteration. The body runs exactly N times.

```python
@qd.kernel(graph=True)
def iterate(x: qd.types.ndarray(qd.f32, ndim=1),
            counter: qd.types.ndarray(qd.i32, ndim=0)):
    while qd.graph_do_while(counter):
        for i in range(x.shape[0]):
            x[i] = x[i] + 1.0
        for i in range(1):
            counter[()] = counter[()] - 1
```

**Boolean flag**: set a `keep_going` flag to 1, have the kernel set it to 0 when a convergence criterion is met.

```python
@qd.kernel(graph=True)
def converge(x: qd.types.ndarray(qd.f32, ndim=1),
             keep_going: qd.types.ndarray(qd.i32, ndim=0)):
    while qd.graph_do_while(keep_going):
        for i in range(x.shape[0]):
            # ... do work ...
            pass
        for i in range(1):
            if some_condition(x):
                keep_going[()] = 0
```

### Do-while semantics

`graph_do_while` has **do-while** semantics: the kernel body always executes at least once before the condition is checked. This matches the behavior of CUDA conditional while nodes. The flag value must be >= 1 at launch time. Passing 0 with a kernel that decrements the counter will cause an infinite loop.

### ndarray vs field

The parameter used by `graph_do_while` MUST be an ndarray.

However, other parameters can be any supported Quadrants kernel parameter type.

### Restrictions

- The same physical ndarray must be used for the counter parameter on every
  call. Passing a different ndarray raises an error, because the counter's
  device pointer is baked into the graph at creation time.

### Caveats

On platforms without native device-side conditional graph nodes — currently CUDA pre-SM 9.0 and **AMDGPU** (HIP has no conditional / while node API as of ROCm 7.2) — the value of the `graph_do_while` parameter will be copied from the GPU to the host each iteration, in order to check whether we should continue iterating. This causes a GPU pipeline stall. At the end of each loop iteration:
- wait for GPU async queue to finish processing
- copy condition value to hostside
- evaluate condition value on hostside
- launch new kernels for next loop iteration, if not finished yet

Note: the basic `graph=True` path (without `graph_do_while`) does **not** stall the host like this on either CUDA or AMDGPU — the entire kernel sequence runs as a single GPU-side graph replay.

Therefore on unsupported platforms, you might consider creating a second implementation, which works differently. e.g.:
- fixed number of loop iterations, so no dependency on gpu data for kernel launch; combined perhaps with:
- make each kernel 'short-circuit', exit quickly, if the task has already been completed; to avoid running the GPU more than necessary
